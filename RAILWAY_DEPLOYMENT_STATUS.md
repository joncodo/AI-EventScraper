## 🚀 **Next Steps**

### **1. Event Collection**
The system is ready to collect events. The background worker will:
- **Run every 10 minutes** to collect new events
- **Use configured APIs** (Facebook, Google, Eventbrite)
- **Track sources** for every event collected
- **Store in database** with full source information

### **2. Test Event Collection**
You can test the system by:
- **Waiting for background worker** to collect events
- **Manually triggering** event collection
- **Checking logs** for event collection progress

### **3. Monitor Performance**
- **Check Railway logs** for event collection
- **Monitor database** for new events
- **Test API endpoints** with real data
