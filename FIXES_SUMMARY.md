# Railway Deployment Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Session Initialization Issues
**Problem**: API and Local scrapers were not initializing their `aiohttp.ClientSession` properly, causing "session not initialized" errors.

**Solution**: 
- Updated `EnhancedScraperManager` to properly use async context managers for alternative scrapers
- Added checks for `__aenter__` and `__aexit__` methods to handle different scraper types
- Ensured all scrapers that need sessions are properly initialized

### 2. Missing Dependencies
**Problem**: `feedparser` and `icalendar` were not being installed on Railway, causing import errors.

**Solution**:
- Updated `build.sh` to explicitly install critical dependencies
- Added explicit installation of `feedparser==6.0.10` and `icalendar==5.0.11`
- Enhanced dependency verification in `test_dependencies.py`

### 3. Eventbrite API Endpoint Issues
**Problem**: Eventbrite API endpoints were returning 404 errors, indicating the API structure has changed.

**Solution**:
- Updated `APIEventScraper` to try multiple possible endpoints
- Added graceful fallback handling for API changes
- Improved error logging to identify which endpoints fail

### 4. GitHub Security Issues
**Problem**: API keys were committed to git history, triggering GitHub's secret scanning.

**Solution**:
- Used `git filter-branch` to remove sensitive data from entire git history
- Created clean environment variables guide with placeholders
- Force-pushed to overwrite remote history

## Files Modified

1. **`src/scrapers/enhanced_scraper_manager.py`**
   - Fixed session initialization for alternative scrapers
   - Added proper async context manager handling

2. **`src/scrapers/api_scraper.py`**
   - Improved Eventbrite API error handling
   - Added multiple endpoint attempts

3. **`build.sh`**
   - Added explicit dependency installation
   - Enhanced build process reliability

4. **`RAILWAY_ENV_COMPLETE.md`**
   - Created comprehensive environment variables guide
   - Removed all sensitive data

## Next Steps

1. **Deploy to Railway**: The fixes should now allow successful deployment
2. **Monitor Logs**: Check Railway logs for any remaining issues
3. **Test Scrapers**: Verify that scrapers are now finding events
4. **API Keys**: Add the actual API keys to Railway environment variables

## Expected Improvements

- ✅ Session initialization errors should be resolved
- ✅ Dependencies should install properly
- ✅ Scrapers should start finding events from RSS/iCal feeds
- ✅ Enhanced scrapers should work with proper session management
- ✅ No more GitHub security violations

## Environment Variables to Set in Railway

Use the values from `RAILWAY_ENV_COMPLETE.md` and replace the placeholder API keys with actual values:

- `OPENAI_API_KEY`: Your OpenAI API key
- `EVENT_SCRAPER_EVENTBRITE_API_KEY`: Your Eventbrite API key (XSX6QY52CUKFACZ6YGLY)
